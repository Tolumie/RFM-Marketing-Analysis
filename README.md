# RFM Marketing Analysis Project  

## Introduction  
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) is a marketing analysis framework used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This project aims to analyze customer transaction data and apply RFM segmentation to identify high-value customers.  

## Objectives  
- Implement RFM analysis to categorize customers.  
- Identify top-performing customers based on purchasing patterns.  
- Provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.  

## RFM Model Breakdown  
RFM analysis is based on three key factors:  
- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer has made a purchase.  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase.  
- **Monetary Value (M):** How much money a customer spends on purchases.  

Each customer is assigned an RFM score based on these factors, which helps in segmentation.  

## Summary  
This RFM analysis project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) to inform data-driven marketing strategies. The project identifies key customer groups, from high-value VIPs and loyal customers to at-risk and lost customers.  

The analysis includes:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- RFM score calculation  
- Customer segmentation  
- Actionable insights for marketing campaigns  
- Clear visualizations and detailed segment descriptions  

## Methodology  

### **1. Data Acquisition and Preparation**  
- **Data Source:** Customer transaction records  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies  
- **Data Type Conversion:**  
  - Date to datetime  
  - Customer ID to integer  
- **Data Description:** Examination of dataset structure and characteristics  

### **2. RFM Score Calculation**  
- **Snapshot Date:** Defined for analysis  
- **Recency Calculation:** Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency Calculation:** Number of transactions per customer  
- **Monetary Value Calculation:** Total amount spent  

### **3. Customer Segmentation**  
- **Quantile-Based Scoring:** Assigning quintile scores (1-5) for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value  
- **Overall RFM Score:** Average of R, F, and M scores  
- **Segment Definitions:** Based on overall RFM score thresholds  

### **4. Visualization and Reporting**  
- **Data Visualization:** Bar charts, pie charts for segment distribution  
- **Report Generation:** Summary of findings, segment profiles, recommendations  

### **5. Insights and Recommendations**
